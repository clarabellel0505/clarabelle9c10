        Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is the son of the chief of Berk, Stoick the Vast. Even though he's not very strong or big like the other Viking kids, Hiccup is smart and inventive. He has a special bond with dragons, especially his best friend Toothless, a rare Night Fury. Hiccup's story is about growing up and finding his own way, showing that being kind and clever can be just as important as being strong. His and Toothless' friendship also taught his people that Vikings and dragons did not have to be enemies and can live in peace and harmony. Throughout the movie, Hiccup grows from a boy to a man and fights enemies who will threaten the peace.</p>
